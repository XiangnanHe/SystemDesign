Design Recommender System

1. Heuristic solution
For example, based on the video costumer viewed, recommend videos from same auther, same category, same label, 
popularity(customer review and # of shares)

2. Collaborative filtering
Find similarity between users or items, and then recommend
User-based CF: similarity between users
Item-based CF: similarity between items

3. Feature engineering
Take youtube video as an example
features such as 
1) Explicit: Like/Share/Subscribe, ratings, favorate, title/label/categories 
2) Implicit: Watch time, freshness

4. Infrastructure
Can be categorized to two parts:
Offline: Big data platform, run periodically, distributed on different clusters
Online: Quick filtering (removed already viewed videos) - freshness and rank from a longer list of videos.

Freshness is important
Evaluation needed to analyze how well the recommender system works
Training of the recommender system requires video position signal, videos ranked on top has better chance to be clicked
